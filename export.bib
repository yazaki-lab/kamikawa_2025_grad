@article{Miyata2012,
  abstract = {We propose an optimal access-point (AP) selection algorithm for maximizing the aggregated throughput of each AP (system throughput) while preserving newly arrived-user throughput in multi rate WLAN system. In our algorithm, newly arrived users cooperate with a wireless local area network (WLAN) system they are trying to use, i.e., they are willing to move toward an appropriate AP before the newly arrived user connects to AP. To select the AP by using our AP selection algorithm, the newly arriving users request two novel parameter values, "the minimum acceptable throughput" with which newly arrived users can be satisfied and "the minimum movable distance" in which a user can move to an appropriate AP. While preserving these conditions, we maximize system throughput. When users cannot obtain a throughput greater than "the minimum acceptable throughput" with our proposed AP selection algorithm, they are rejected. Because, if users use streaming applications, which have strict bandwidth demands, with a very low bit-rate connection, they will not be satisfied. Thus, the newly arrived users having low bit-rate connection may be allowed to be rejected before the newly arrived user connects. In this paper, we show the optimal AP by using theoretical proof. We discuss the effectiveness of our proposed AP selection algorithm by using numerical analysis. We also clarify and analyze the characteristics of system throughput. Moreover, we show that a newly arrived user can select the movable distance and acceptable throughput by using examples from graphs depicting every position of newly arrived users. By using the graphs, we also show the relationship between the two parameters (the movable distance and the acceptable throughput) and the optimal AP, and the relationship between the two parameters and optimal system throughput when the movable distance and acceptable throughput are variable.

  abstract = {A graph neural network (GNN) based access point (AP) selection algorithm for cell-free mas-sive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is proposed. Two graphs, a homogeneous graph which includes only AP nodes representing the structure of the APs in the network, and a heterogeneous graph which includes both AP nodes and user equipment (UE) nodes are constructed to represent a cell-free massive MIMO network. A GNN based on the inductive graph learning framework GraphSAGE is used to obtain the embed-dings which are then used to predict the links between the nodes. The numerical results show that compared to the proximity-based AP selection algorithms, the proposed GNN based algorithm predicts the potential APs with more accuracy. Compared to the large scale fading coefficient based AP selection algorithms, the proposed algorithm does not require measured and sorted signal strengths of all the neighbouring APs. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is scalable in terms of the number of users in the cell-free system.},

@article{Wu2024,
  abstract = {Wireless Local-Area Networks (WLANs), as a popular internet access solution, are widely used in numerous places, including enterprises, campuses, and public venues. As the number of devices increases, large-scale deployments will cause the problem of dense wireless networks, including a lot of energy consumption. Thus, the optimization of energy-efficient wireless AP devices has become a focal point of attention. To reduce energy consumption, we have proposed the active access-point (AP) configuration algorithm for WLANs using APs with a dual interface. This uses the greedy algorithm combined with the local search optimization method to find the minimum number of activated APs while satisfying the minimum throughput constraint. However, the previous algorithm basically satisfies only the average throughput among the multiple hosts associated with one AP, wherein some hosts may not reach the required one. In this paper, to overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced active AP configuration algorithm by incorporating the throughput request satisfaction method that controls the actual throughput at the target value (target throughput) for every host by applying traffic shaping. The target throughput is calculated from the single and concurrent communicating throughput of each host based on channel occupancy time. The minimum throughput constraint will be iteratively adjusted to obtain the required target throughput and achieve the fair throughput allocation. For evaluations, we conducted simulations using the WIMNET simulator and experiments using the testbed system with a Raspberry Pi 4B for APs in four topology cases with five APs and ten hosts. The results show that the proposed method always achieved the required minimum throughput in simulations as well as in experiments, while minimizing the number of active APs. Thus, the validity and effectiveness of our proposal were confirmed.},

@article{GaonaJurez2025,
  abstract = {This article describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of an indoor localization system based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements in wireless sensor networks. While the majority of the literature uses the IEEE 802.15 standard for this type of system, all of the measurements in this study were performed using a test bench operating under the IEEE 802.11ax standard in the 2.4 GHz band. RSSI is widely used due to its simplicity and availability; however, its accuracy is limited by signal attenuation, electromagnetic interference, and environmental variability. To mitigate these limitations, the present work proposes the implementation of advanced techniques, including weighted averages and positioning algorithms such as Min–Max, Maximum Likelihood, and trilateration, aiming to achieve an accuracy of 2 m in controlled conditions. The design also included a specialized test bench to calculate the coordinates and estimate the location of unknown nodes using anchor node positioning. This approach combines the simplicity of RSSI with optimized algorithms, providing a robust and practical solution for indoor localization. The results validate the system's effectiveness and highlight its potential for future applications in real-world environments, opening new possibilities for optimizing wireless sensor networks and addressing the current challenges in localization systems.},

Therefore, it is challenging to evaluate the health of a network or make changes to ensure an optimal configuration. Traditional visualization approaches, such as contour lines, are not intuitive and lead to challenges in the analysis and comprehension of networks. In this paper, we introduce two novel visualizations: Wavelines and Stacked Bars. We then compared these visualizations to the state-of-the-art visualization technique of contour lines. We carried out a user study with 32 participants to validate that our novel visualizations can improve user confidence, accuracy, and completion time for the tasks of router localization, ranking of signal strengths, channel interference, and router coverage. We selected these tasks after extensive discussions with domain experts. We believe that our findings will assist network analysts in visually understanding our increasingly rich signal environments.},

abstract = {Network slicing will allow 5G network operators to offer a diverse set of services over a shared physical infrastructure. We focus on supporting the operation of the Radio Access Network (RAN) slice broker, which maps slice requirements into allocation of Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs). We first develop a new metric, REVA, based on the number of PRBs available to a single Very Active bearer. REVA is independent of channel conditions and allows easy derivation of an individual wireless link's throughput. In order for the slice broker to efficiently utilize the RAN, there is a need for reliable and short term prediction of resource usage by a slice. To support such prediction, we construct an LTE testbed and develop custom additions to the scheduler. Using data collected from the testbed, we compute REVA and develop a realistic time series prediction model for REVA. Specifically, we present the X-LSTM prediction model, based upon Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Evaluated with data collected in the testbed, X-LSTM outperforms Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) and LSTM neural networks by up to 31\%. X-LSTM also achieves over 91\% accuracy in predicting REVA. By using X-LSTM to predict future usage, a slice broker is more adept to provision a slice and reduce over-provisioning and SLA violation costs by more than 10\% in comparison to LSTM and ARIMA.},
